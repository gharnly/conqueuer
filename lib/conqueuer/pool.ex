defmodule Conqueuer.Pool do
  @moduledoc """
  Use this mixin to define a poolboy pool and supervisor.

  Given you want a pool named `:resolvers` and will define a worker named
  `MyApp.ResolverWorker`:

      defmodule MyApp.ResolversPoolSupervisor do
        use Conqueuer.Pool, name: :resolvers,
                            worker: MyApp.ResolverWorker,
                            worker_args: [arg1: 1],
                            size: 10,
                            max_overflow: 20
      end

  The `worker_args` argument is used for set up the initial state of your
  worker, as they are passed through to the worker's `start_link` function and
  eventually to the `init` function.  The Worker module implements a default
  `init` function sets the `worker_args` as the worker's initial state.  You may
  override the `init` function and use the options to set up a more custom initial
  state.

  The `size` and `max_overflow` arguments are optional and if not provided the
  defaults are `size: 1` and `max_overflow: 0`.  For more information on these
  options please see the poolboy project's [documentation](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy)
  or this [article](http://hashnuke.com/2013/10/03/managing-processes-with-poolboy-in-elixir.html).

  Now that the `:resolvers` pool and supervisor is defined you will need to add it to your
  supervision tree.

      defmodule Test do
        use Application

        def start(_type, _args) do
          import Supervisor.Spec, warn: false

          children = [
            supervisor( MyApp.ResolversPoolSupervisor, [[], [name: :ResolversPoolSupervisor]] ),
            ...
          ]

          Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
        end
      end

  The name of the supervisor process is very important as it's collaborators
  infer its name through convention.
